The CAOS team were working on a very simple operating system, CAOS, the CAnes 
Operating Systems. And because they are really old people and never really wanted
to change how they did things, the are writing the operating system on punched
cards.

Unfortunately, if you drop a deck of punched cards, they get scrambled. The lines
are ok, the words and characters do not get scrambled. But the lines get shuffled. 
And that is what happened to their shell program, coas-sh.c

Your assignment is to put it back in order.

Here is a sample session with caos-sh when it is working:

    ojo@raritan quiz5 % make
    cc -o caos-sh caos-sh.c
    ojo@raritan quiz5 % ./caos-sh 
    ?: l
    Makefile	caos-sh		caos-sh.c
    ?: d

    possible commands are - l: ls, p: ps, d: date
    ?: p
