1) Copy the class/quiz4 contents to your _username_/quiz4 folder. 
2) Put your name after "Name:", above. Then svn add and commit.
3) Complete the assignment:

You are provided with a quiz4.c file, an empty quiz4.h file, an empty
quiz4-sub.c file, and a Makefile.

As delivered, most of the code is present, but to complete the quiz you 
must move all the subroutines (except main) to the quiz4-sub.c file.

You will need to modify and include the quiz4.h, and modify the Makefile 
to include build target for quiz4-sub.o.

You also need to complete the print_all routine to print all the words in
the word_array, with delimit separating the words, and a \n after the 
last word.

For a completely correct Makefile, consider all dependencies and add a clean
target that remove build products.
